
#### Problem statement:

The dataset consists of 1376 images consisting of two
classes â€“ with_mask and without_mask. The objective
to create a Face Mask Detector using CNN and
OpenCV.


- Used haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml to detect faces
- The dataset is an artificial set of face mask images.
- Dataset: https://data-flair.training/blogs/download-face-mask-data
- The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing
a face mask or not
