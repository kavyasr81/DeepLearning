### Problem statement

The dataset consists of 2-Dimensional spectrograms of
radio signals from space collected at the SETI Institute
by the Allen Telescope Array. The objective is to
classify the radio signals from outer space into one of
four classes.

#### Dataset Description:

Training Data:
 - train_images: Normalized values of Pixels
 -  train_labels: Stored as One-Hot Encoded data
 
Validation Data:
 - val_images: Normalized values of Pixels
 - val_labels: Stored as One-Hot Encoded data
 - Classes: “squiggle”, “narrowband”, “narrowbanddrd”, and “noise”

The  objective  is  to classify the radio signals from outer space into one of
the four classes using CNN.
